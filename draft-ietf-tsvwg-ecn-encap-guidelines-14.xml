      <t>The purpose of this document is to guide the design of congestion
      notification in any lower layer or tunnelling protocol that encapsulates
      IP. The aim is for explicit congestion signals to propagate consistently
      from lower layer protocols into IP. Then the IP internetwork layer can
      act as a portability layer to carry congestion notification from
      non-IP-aware congested nodes up to the transport layer (L4). Following
      these guidelines should assure interworking among IP layer and lower
      layer congestion notification mechanisms, whether specified by the IETF
      or other standards bodies. This document updates the advice to
      subnetwork designers about ECN in RFC 3819.</t>

    <section anchor="ecnencap_Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>The benefits of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) described in
      <xref target="RFC8087"/> and summarized below can only be fully realized
      if support for ECN is added to the relevant subnetwork technology, as
      well as to IP. When a lower layer buffer drops a packet obviously it
      does not just drop at that layer; the packet disappears from all layers.
      In contrast, when active queue management (AQM) at a lower layer marks a
      packet with ECN, the marking needs to be explicitly propagated up the
      layers. The same is true if AQM marks the outer header of a packet that
      encapsulates inner tunnelled headers. Forwarding ECN is not as
      straightforward as other headers because it has to be assumed ECN may be
      only partially deployed. If a lower layer header that contains ECN
      congestion indications is stripped off by a subnet egress that is not
      ECN-aware, or if the ultimate receiver or sender is not ECN-aware,
      congestion needs to be indicated by dropping a packet, not marking
      it.</t>

      <t>The purpose of this document is to guide the addition of congestion
      notification to any subnet technology or tunnelling protocol, so that
      lower layer AQM algorithms can signal congestion explicitly and it will
      propagate consistently into encapsulated (higher layer) headers,
      otherwise the signals will not reach their ultimate destination.</t>

      <t>ECN is defined in the IP header (v4 and v6) <xref target="RFC3168"/>
      to allow a resource to notify the onset of queue build-up without having
      to drop packets, by explicitly marking a proportion of packets with the
      congestion experienced (CE) codepoint.<!--In the layered model of communication, each layer accepts requests to forward PDUs and eventually returns 
a status code to the higher layer. Without ECN, each layer returns either a 'delivered' status code or an 
implicit 'not delivered'. Explicit notification of congestion adds a useful 'delivered but congestion 
experienced' status code to each layer interface.--></t>

      <t>Given a suitable marking scheme, ECN removes nearly all congestion
      loss and it cuts delays for two main reasons: <list style="symbols">
          <t>It avoids the delay when recovering from congestion losses, which
          particularly benefits small flows or real-time flows, making their
          delivery time predictably short <xref target="RFC2884"/>;</t>

          <t>As ECN is used more widely by end-systems, it will gradually
          remove the need to configure a degree of delay into buffers before
          they start to notify congestion (the cause of bufferbloat). This is
          because drop involves a trade-off between sending a timely signal
          and trying to avoid impairment, whereas ECN is solely a signal not
          an impairment, so there is no harm triggering it earlier.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Some lower layer technologies (e.g. MPLS, Ethernet) are used to form
      subnetworks with IP-aware nodes only at the edges. These networks are
      often sized so that it is rare for interior queues to overflow. However,
      until recently this was more due to the inability of TCP to saturate the
      links. For many years, fixes such as window scaling <xref
      target="RFC7323"/> proved hard to deploy. And the Reno variant of TCP
      has remained in widespread use despite its inability to scale to high
      flow rates. However, now that modern operating systems are finally
      capable of saturating interior links, even the buffers of
      well-provisioned interior switches will need to signal episodes of
      queuing.</t>

      <t>Propagation of ECN is defined for MPLS <xref target="RFC5129"/>, and
      is being defined for TRILL <xref target="RFC7780"/>, <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-trill-ecn-support"/>, but it remains to be defined for
      a number of other subnetwork technologies.</t>

      <t>Similarly, ECN propagation is yet to be defined for many tunnelling
      protocols. <xref target="RFC6040"/> defines how ECN should be propagated
      for IP-in-IPv4 <xref target="RFC2003"/>, IP-in-IPv6 <xref
      target="RFC2473"/> and IPsec <xref target="RFC4301"/> tunnels, but there
      are numerous other tunnelling protocols with a shim and/or a layer 2
      header between two IP headers (v4 or v6). Some address ECN propagation
      between the IP headers, but many do not. This document gives guidance on
      how to address ECN propagation for future tunnelling protocols, and a
      companion standards track specification <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rfc6040update-shim"/> updates those existing
      IP-shim-(L2)-IP protocols that are under IETF change control and still
      widely used.</t>

      <t>Incremental deployment is the most delicate aspect when adding
      support for ECN. The original ECN protocol in IP <xref
      target="RFC3168"/> was carefully designed so that a congested buffer
      would not mark a packet (rather than drop it) unless both source and
      destination hosts were ECN-capable. Otherwise its congestion markings
      would never be detected and congestion would just build up further.
      However, to support congestion marking below the IP layer or within
      tunnels, it is not sufficient to only check that the two layer 4
      transport end-points support ECN; correct operation also depends on the
      decapsulator at each subnet or tunnel egress faithfully propagating
      congestion notifications to the higher layer. Otherwise, a legacy
      decapsulator might silently fail to propagate any ECN signals from the
      outer to the forwarded header. Then the lost signals would never be
      detected and again congestion would build up further. The guidelines
      given later require protocol designers to carefully consider incremental
      deployment, and suggest various safe approaches for different
      circumstances.</t>

      <t>Of course, the IETF does not have standards authority over every link
      layer protocol. So this document gives guidelines for designing
      propagation of congestion notification across the interface between IP
      and protocols that may encapsulate IP (i.e. that can be layered beneath
      IP). Each lower layer technology will exhibit different issues and
      compromises, so the IETF or the relevant standards body must be free to
      define the specifics of each lower layer congestion notification scheme.
      Nonetheless, if the guidelines are followed, congestion notification
      should interwork between different technologies, using IP in its role as
      a 'portability layer'.</t>

      <t>Therefore, the capitalized terms 'SHOULD' or 'SHOULD NOT' are often
      used in preference to 'MUST' or 'MUST NOT', because it is difficult to
      know the compromises that will be necessary in each protocol design. If
      a particular protocol design chooses not to follow a 'SHOULD (NOT)'
      given in the advice below, it MUST include a sound justification.</t>

      <t>It has not been possible to give common guidelines for all lower
      layer technologies, because they do not all fit a common pattern.
      Instead they have been divided into a few distinct modes of operation:
      feed-forward-and-upward; feed-upward-and-forward; feed-backward; and
      null mode. These modes are described in <xref target="ecnencap_Modes"/>,
      then in the subsequent sections separate guidelines are given for each
      mode.</t>

      <section title="Update to RFC 3819">
        <t>This document updates the brief advice to subnetwork designers
        about ECN in <xref target="RFC3819"/>, by replacing the last two
        paragraphs of Section 13 with the following sentence:<list
            style="empty">
            <t>By following the guidelines in [this document], subnetwork
            designers can enable a layer-2 protocol to participate in
            congestion control without dropping packets via propagation of
            explicit congestion notification (ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/>) to
            receivers.</t>
          </list>and adding [this document] as an informative reference. {RFC
        Editor: Please replace both instances of [this document] above with
        the number of the present RFC when published.}</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="ecnencap_Scope" title="Scope">
        <t>This document only concerns wire protocol processing of explicit
        notification of congestion. It makes no changes or recommendations
        concerning algorithms for congestion marking or for congestion
        response, because algorithm issues should be independent of the layer
        the algorithm operates in.</t>

        <t>The default ECN semantics are described in <xref target="RFC3168"/>
        and updated by <xref target="RFC8311"/>. Also the guidelines for AQM
        designers <xref target="RFC7567"/> clarify the semantics of both drop
        and ECN signals from AQM algorithms. <xref target="RFC4774"/> is the
        appropriate best current practice specification of how algorithms with
        alternative semantics for the ECN field can be partitioned from
        Internet traffic that uses the default ECN semantics. There are two
        main examples for how alternative ECN semantics have been defined in
        practice:<list style="symbols">
            <t>RFC 4774 suggests using the ECN field in combination with a
            Diffserv codepoint such as in PCN <xref target="RFC6660"/>, Voice
            over 3G <xref target="UTRAN"/> or Voice over LTE (VoLTE) <xref
            target="LTE-RA"/>;</t>

            <t>RFC 8311 suggests using the ECT(1) codepoint of the ECN field
            to indicate alternative semantics such as for the experimental Low
            Latency Low Loss Scalable throughput (L4S) service <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id"/>).</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>The aim is that the default rules for encapsulating and
        decapsulating the ECN field are sufficiently generic that tunnels and
        subnets will encapsulate and decapsulate packets without regard to how
        algorithms elsewhere are setting or interpreting the semantics of the
        ECN field. <xref target="RFC6040"/> updates RFC 4774 to allow
        alternative encapsulation and decapsulation behaviours to be defined
        for alternative ECN semantics. However it reinforces the same point -
        that it is far preferable to try to fit within the common ECN
        encapsulation and decapsulation behaviours, because expecting all
        lower layer technologies and tunnels to be updated is likely to be
        completely impractical.</t>

        <t>Alternative semantics for the ECN field can be defined to depend on
        the traffic class indicated by the DSCP. Therefore correct propagation
        of congestion signals could depend on correct propagation of the DSCP
        between the layers and along the path. For instance, if the meaning of
        the ECN field depends on the DSCP (as in PCN or VoLTE) and if the
        outer DSCP is stripped on descapsulation, as in the pipe model of
        <xref target="RFC2983"/>, the special semantics of the ECN field would
        be lost. Similarly, if the DSCP is changed at the boundary between
        Diffserv domains, the special ECN semantics would also be lost. This
        is an important implication of the localized scope of most Diffserv
        arrangements. In this document, correct propagation of traffic class
        information is assumed, while what 'correct' means and how it is
        achieved is covered elsewhere (e.g. RFC 2983) and is outside the scope
        of the present document.</t>

        <t>The guidelines in this document do ensure that common encapsulation
        and decapsulation rules are sufficiently generic to cover cases where
        ECT(1) is used instead of ECT(0) to identify alternative ECN semantics
        (as in L4S <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-l4s-id"/>) and where ECN
        marking algorithms use ECT(1) to encode 3 severity levels into the ECN
        field (e.g. PCN <xref target="RFC6660"/>) rather than the default of
        2. All these different semantics for the ECN field work because it has
        been possible to define common default decapsulation rules that allow
        for all cases.</t>

        <t>Note that the guidelines in this document do not necessarily
        require the subnet wire protocol to be changed to add support for
        congestion notification. For instance, the Feed-Up-and-Forward Mode
        (<xref target="ecnencap_Up"/>) and the Null Mode (<xref
        target="ecnencap_Null"/>) do not. Another way to add congestion
        notification without consuming header space in the subnet protocol
        might be to use a parallel control plane protocol.</t>

        <t>This document focuses on the congestion notification interface
        between IP and lower layer or tunnel protocols that can encapsulate
        IP, where the term 'IP' includes v4 or v6, unicast, multicast or
        anycast. However, it is likely that the guidelines will also be useful
        when a lower layer protocol or tunnel encapsulates itself, e.g.
        Ethernet MAC in MAC (<xref target="IEEE802.1Q"/>; previously 802.1ah)
        or when it encapsulates other protocols. In the feed-backward mode,
        propagation of congestion signals for multicast and anycast packets is
        out-of-scope (because the complexity would make it unlikely to be
        attempted).</t>

      <t>This section sets down the different modes by which congestion

        <t>In these cases, ECN may best be supported by standardising explicit
        notification of congestion into the lower layer protocol that carries
        the data forwards. Then a specification is needed for how the egress
        of the lower layer subnet propagates this explicit signal into the
        forwarded upper layer (IP) header. This signal continues forwards
        until it finally reaches the destination transport (at L4). Then
        typically the destination will feed this congestion notification back
        to the source transport using an end-to-end protocol (e.g. TCP). This
        is the arrangement that has already been used to add ECN to IP-in-IP
        tunnels <xref target="RFC6040"/>, IP-in-MPLS and MPLS-in-MPLS <xref
        target="RFC5129"/>.</t>

        <t>This mode is illustrated in <xref
        target="ecnencap_Fig_Feed-Forward-and-Up"/>. Along the middle of the
        figure, layers 2, 3 and 4 of the protocol stack are shown, and one
        packet is shown along the bottom as it progresses across the network
        from source to destination, crossing two subnets connected by a
        router, and crossing two switches on the path across each subnet.
        Congestion at the output of the first switch (shown as *) leads to a
        congestion marking in the L2 header (shown as C in the illustration of
        the packet). The chevrons show the progress of the resulting
        congestion indication. It is propagated from link to link across the
        subnet in the L2 header, then when the router removes the marked L2
        header, it propagates the marking up into the L3 (IP) header. The
        router forwards the marked L3 header into subnet 2, and when it adds a
        new L2 header it copies the L3 marking into the L2 header as well, as
        shown by the 'C's in both layers (assuming the technology of subnet 2
        also supports explicit congestion marking).</t>

        <t>Note that there is no implication that each 'C' marking is encoded
        the same; a different encoding might be used for the 'C' marking in
        each protocol.</t>

        <t>Finally, for completeness, we show the L3 marking arriving at the
        destination, where the host transport protocol (e.g. TCP) feeds it
        back to the source in the L4 acknowledgement (the 'C' at L4 in the
        packet at the top of the diagram).</t>

        <t>Of course, modern networks are rarely as simple as this text-book
        example, often involving multiple nested layers. For example, a 3GPP
        mobile network may have two IP-in-IP (GTP <xref target="GTPv1"/>)
        tunnels in series and an MPLS backhaul between the base station and
        the first router. Nonetheless, the example illustrates the general
        idea of feeding congestion notification forward then upward whenever a
        header is removed at the egress of a subnet.</t>

        <t>Note that the FECN (forward ECN ) bit in Frame Relay <xref
        target="Buck00"/> and the explicit forward congestion indication (EFCI
        <xref target="ITU-T.I.371"/>) bit in ATM user data cells follow a
        feed-forward pattern. However, in ATM, this arrangement is only part
        of a feed-forward-and-backward pattern at the lower layer, not
        feed-forward-and-up out of the lower layer&mdash;the intention was
        never to interface to IP ECN at the subnet egress. To our knowledge,
        Frame Relay FECN is solely used to detect where more capacity should
        be provisioned.</t>

        <t>Ethernet is particularly difficult to extend incrementally to
        support explicit congestion notification. One way to support ECN in
        such cases has been to use so called 'layer-3 switches'. These are
        Ethernet switches that dig into the Ethernet payload to find an IP
        header and manipulate or act on certain IP fields (specifically
        Diffserv &amp; ECN). For instance, in Data Center TCP <xref
        target="RFC8257"/>, layer-3 switches are configured to mark the ECN
        field of the IP header within the Ethernet payload when their output
        buffer becomes congested. With respect to switching, a layer-3 switch
        acts solely on the addresses in the Ethernet header; it does not use
        IP addresses, and it does not decrement the TTL field in the IP
        header.</t>

        <t>By comparing <xref target="ecnencap_Fig_Feed-Up"/> with <xref
        target="ecnencap_Fig_Feed-Forward-and-Up"/>, it can be seen that
        subnet E (perhaps a subnet of layer-3 Ethernet switches) works in
        feed-up-and-forward mode by notifying congestion directly into L3 at
        the point of congestion, even though the congested switch does not
        otherwise act at L3. In this example, the technology in subnet F (e.g.
        MPLS) does support ECN natively, so when the router adds the layer-2
        header it copies the ECN marking from L3 to L2 as well.</t>

        <t>In some layer 2 technologies, explicit congestion notification has

        ECN has not been defined.</t>

        <t>For instance, for the available bit-rate (ABR) service in ATM, the
        relative rate mechanism was one of the more popular mechanisms for
        managing traffic, tending to supersede earlier designs. In this
        approach ATM switches send special resource management (RM) cells in
        both the forward and backward directions to control the ingress rate
        of user data into a virtual circuit. If a switch buffer is approaching

        <t>ATM's feed-backward approach does not fit well when layered beneath
        IP's feed-forward approach&mdash;unless the initial data source is the
        same node as the ATM ingress. <!--(which would be the case if ATM had achieved its aspiration of becoming the global internetwork standard, 
rather than just a subnetwork technology)--><xref
        target="ecnencap_Fig_Feed-Backward"/> shows the feed-backward approach
        being used in subnet H. If the final switch on the path is congested
        (*), it does not feed-forward any congestion indications on packet
        (U). Instead it sends a control cell (V) back to the router at the ATM
        ingress.</t>

        <t>However, the backward feedback does not reach the original data
        source directly because IP does not support backward feedback (and
        subnet G is independent of subnet H). Instead, the router in the
        middle throttles down its sending rate but the original data sources
        don't reduce their rates. The resulting rate mismatch causes the
        middle router's buffer at layer 3 to back up until it becomes
        congested, which it signals forwards on later data packets at layer 3
        (e.g. packet W). Note that the forward signal from the middle router
        is not triggered directly by the backward signal. Rather, it is
        triggered by congestion resulting from the middle router's mismatched
        rate response to the backward signal.</t>

        <t>In response to this later forward signalling, end-to-end feedback
        at layer-4 finally completes the tortuous path of congestion
        indications back to the origin data source, as before.</t>

        <t>Quantized congestion notification (QCN <xref target="IEEE802.1Q"/>)
        would suffer from similar problems if extended to multiple subnets.
        However, from the start QCN was clearly characterized as solely
        applicable to a single subnet (see <xref
        target="ecnencap_Guidelines_Backward"/>).</t>

        <!--To summarise so far, feeding congestion notification backwards can reach the source faster, but only 
if the congested subnet is directly connected to the original data source. In a more general case, 
feedback takes a tortuous path part-way backwards, which can lead to queuing at the higher layer in 
the middle of the network, which can in turn trigger a much-delayed feed-forward signal, which then 
has to be fed back from destination to source.-->

        <t>Often link and physical layer resources are 'non-blocking' by

        <t>A degenerate example is a point-to-point Ethernet link. Excess
        loading of the link merely causes the queue from the higher layer to
        back up, while the lower layer remains immune to congestion. Even a

        limiting ingress capacity and sufficient sizing of interior links,

      <section anchor="ecnencap_IP-IP_Coupled_Shim_Tunnels"
               title="IP-in-IP Tunnels with Shim Headers">
        <t>A common pattern for many tunnelling protocols is to encapsulate an
        inner IP header with shim header(s) then an outer IP header. A shim
        header is defined as one that is not sufficient alone to forward the
        packet as an outer header. Another common pattern is for a shim to
        encapsulate a layer 2 (L2) header, which in turn encapsulates (or
        might encapsulate) an IP header. <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rfc6040update-shim"/> clarifies that RFC 6040
        is just as applicable when there are shim(s) and possibly a L2 header
        between two IP headers.</t>

        <t>However, it is not always feasible or necessary to propagate ECN
        between IP headers when separated by a shim. For instance, it might be
        too costly to dig to arbitrary depths to find an inner IP header,
        there may be little or no congestion within the tunnel by design (see
        null mode in <xref target="ecnencap_Null"/> above), or a legacy
        implementation might not support ECN. In cases where a tunnel does not
        support ECN, it is important that the ingress does not copy the ECN
        field from an inner IP header to an outer. Therefore section 4 of
        <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rfc6040update-shim"/> requires network
        operators to configure the ingress of a tunnel that does not support
        ECN so that it zeros the ECN field in the outer IP header.</t>

        <t>Nonetheless, in many cases it is feasible to propagate the ECN
        field between IP headers separated by shim header(s) and/or a L2
        header. Particularly in the typical case when the outer IP header and
        the shim(s) are added (or removed) as part of the same procedure. Even
        if the shim(s) encapsulate a L2 header, it is often possible to find
        an inner IP header within the L2 PDU and propagate ECN between that
        and the outer IP header. This can be thought of as a special case of
        the feed-up-and-forward mode (<xref target="ecnencap_Up"/>), so the
        guidelines for this mode apply (<xref
        target="ecnencap_Guidelines_Up"/>).</t>

        <t>Numerous shim protocols have been defined for IP tunnelling. More
        recent ones e.g. Generic UDP Encapsulation (GUE) <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-intarea-gue"/> and Geneve <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve"/> cite and follow RFC 6040. And some
        earlier ones, e.g. CAPWAP <xref target="RFC5415"/> and LISP <xref
        target="RFC6830"/>, cite RFC 3168, which is compatible with RFC
        6040.</t>

        <t>However, as Section 9.3 of RFC 3168 pointed out, ECN support needs
        to be defined for many earlier shim-based tunnelling protocols, e.g.
        L2TPv2 <xref target="RFC2661"/>, L2TPv3 <xref target="RFC3931"/>, GRE
        <xref target="RFC2784"/>, PPTP <xref target="RFC2637"/>, GTP <xref
        target="GTPv1"/>, <xref target="GTPv1-U"/>, <xref target="GTPv2-C"/>
        and Teredo <xref target="RFC4380"/> as well as some recent ones, e.g.
        VXLAN <xref target="RFC7348"/>, NVGRE <xref target="RFC7637"/> and NSH
        <xref target="RFC8300"/>.</t>

        <t>All these IP-based encapsulations can be updated in one shot by
        simple reference to RFC 6040. However, it would not be appropriate to
        update all these protocols from within the present guidance document.
        Instead a companion specification <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rfc6040update-shim"/> has been prepared that
        has the appropriate standards track status to update standards track
        protocols. For those that are not under IETF change control <xref
        target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rfc6040update-shim"/> can only recommend that
        the relevant body updates them.</t>

            style="numbers">
            <t>SHOULD NOT apply explicit congestion notifications to PDUs that

            on a feedback loop that will propagate congestion notification
            properly because it meets both the above criteria. And a
            Not-ECN-PDU is a PDU on a feedback loop that does not meet at
            least one of the criteria, and will therefore not propagate
            congestion notification properly. A corollary of the above is that
            a lower layer congestion notification protocol:</t>

            <t>SHOULD be able to distinguish ECN-PDUs from Not-ECN-PDUs.</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Note that there is no need for all interior nodes within a subnet
        to be able to mark congestion explicitly. A mix of ECN and drop
        signals from different nodes is fine. However, if <spanx style="emph">any</spanx>
        interior nodes might generate ECN markings, guideline <xref
        format="counter" target="ecnencap_Egress_Check"/> above says that all
        relevant egress node(s) SHOULD be able to propagate those markings up
        to the higher layer.</t>

        <t>In IP, if the ECN field in each PDU is cleared to the Not-ECT (not
        ECN-capable transport) codepoint, it indicates that the L4 transport
        will not understand congestion markings. A congested buffer must not
        mark these Not-ECT PDUs, and therefore drops them instead.</t>

        <t>The mechanism a lower layer uses to distinguish the ECN-capability
        of PDUs need not mimic that of IP. The above guidelines merely say
        that the lower layer system, as a whole, should achieve the same
        outcome. For instance, ECN-capable feedback loops might use PDUs that
        are identified by a particular set of labels or tags. Alternatively,
        logical link protocols that use flow state might determine whether a
        PDU can be congestion marked by checking for ECN-support in the flow
        state. Other protocols might depend on out-of-band control
        signals.</t>

        <t>The per-domain checking of ECN support in MPLS <xref
        target="RFC5129"/> is a good example of a way to avoid sending
        congestion markings to L4 transports that will not understand them,
        without using any header space in the subnet protocol.</t>

        <t>In MPLS, header space is extremely limited, therefore RFC5129 does
        not provide a field in the MPLS header to indicate whether the PDU is
        an ECN-PDU or a Not-ECN-PDU. Instead, interior nodes in a domain are
        allowed to set explicit congestion indications without checking
        whether the PDU is destined for a L4 transport that will understand
        them. Nonetheless, this is made safe by requiring that the network
        operator upgrades all decapsulating edges of a whole domain at once,
        as soon as even one switch within the domain is configured to mark
        rather than drop during congestion. Therefore, any edge node that
        might decapsulate a packet will be capable of checking whether the
        higher layer transport is ECN-capable. When decapsulating a CE-marked
        packet, if the decapsulator discovers that the higher layer (inner
        header) indicates the transport is not ECN-capable, it drops the
        packet&mdash;effectively on behalf of the earlier congested node (see
        Decapsulation Guideline <xref format="counter"
        target="ecnencap_dropNot-ECTinnerCEouter"/> in <xref
        target="ecnencap_DecapGuidelines"/>).</t>

        <t>It was only appropriate to define such an incremental deployment
        strategy because MPLS is targeted solely at professional operators,
        who can be expected to ensure that a whole subnetwork is consistently
        configured. This strategy might not be appropriate for other link
        technologies targeted at zero-configuration deployment or deployment
        by the general public (e.g. Ethernet). For such 'plug-and-play'
        environments it will be necessary to invent a failsafe approach that
        ensures congestion markings will never fall into black holes, no
        matter how inconsistently a system is put together. Alternatively,
        congestion notification relying on correct system configuration could
        be confined to flavours of Ethernet intended only for professional
        network operators, such as Provider Backbone Bridges (PBB <xref
        target="IEEE802.1Q"/>; previously 802.1ah).</t>

        <t>ECN support in TRILL <xref target="I-D.ietf-trill-ecn-support"/>
        provides a good example of how to add ECN to a lower layer protocol
        without relying on careful and consistent operator configuration.
        TRILL provides an extension header word with space for flags of
        different categories depending on whether logic to understand the
        extension is critical. The congestion experienced marking has been
        defined as a 'critical ingress-to-egress' flag. So if a transit
        RBridge sets this flag and an egress RBridge does not have any logic
        to process it, it will drop it; which is the desired default action
        anyway. Therefore TRILL RBridges can be updated with support for ECN
        in no particular order and, at the egress of the TRILL campus,
        congestion notification will be propagated to IP as ECN whenever ECN
        logic has been implemented, or as drop otherwise.</t>

        <t>QCN <xref target="IEEE802.1Q"/> is not intended to extend beyond a
        single subnet, or to interoperate with ECN. Nonetheless, the way QCN
        indicates to lower layer devices that the end-points will not
        understand QCN provides another example that a lower layer protocol
        designer might be able to mimic for their scenario. An operator can
        define certain Priority Code Points (PCPs <xref target="IEEE802.1Q"/>;
        previously 802.1p) to indicate non-QCN frames and an ingress bridge is
        required to map arriving not-QCN-capable IP packets to one of these
        non-QCN PCPs.</t>

        <t>This section is intended to guide the redesign of any node that

        ECN support to the lower layer protocol. It reflects the approaches
        used in <xref target="RFC6040"/> and in <xref target="RFC5129"/>.

        <t>A subnet egress SHOULD NOT simply copy congestion notification from
        outer headers to the forwarded header. It SHOULD calculate the
        outgoing congestion notification field from the inner and outer
        headers using the following guidelines. If there is any conflict,

        list:<list style="numbers">
            <t anchor="ecnencap_dropNot-ECTinnerCEouter">If the arriving inner
            header is a Not-ECN-PDU it implies the L4 transport will not
            understand explicit congestion markings. Then:<list
                style="symbols">
                <t>If the outer header carries an explicit congestion marking,
                drop is the only indication of congestion that the L4
                transport will understand. If the congestion marking is the
                most severe possible, the packet MUST be dropped. However, if
                congestion can be marked with multiple levels of severity and
                the packet's marking is not the most severe, this requirement
                can be relaxed to: the packet SHOULD be dropped.</t>

                <t>If the outer is an ECN-PDU that carries no indication of
                congestion or a Not-ECN-PDU the PDU SHOULD be forwarded, but
                still as a Not-ECN-PDU.</t>
              </list></t>

            <t>If the outer header does not support explicit congestion
            notification (a Not-ECN-PDU), but the inner header does (an
            ECN-PDU), the inner header SHOULD be forwarded unchanged.</t>

            <t>In some lower layer protocols congestion may be signalled as a
            numerical level, such as in the control frames of quantized
            congestion notification (QCN <xref target="IEEE802.1Q"/>). If such
            a multi-bit encoding encapsulates an ECN-capable IP data packet, a
            function will be needed to convert the quantized congestion level
            into the frequency of congestion markings in outgoing IP
            packets.</t>

            <t>Congestion indications might be encoded by a severity level.
            For instance increasing levels of congestion might be encoded by
            numerically increasing indications, e.g. pre-congestion
            notification (PCN) can be encoded in each PDU at three severity
            levels in IP or MPLS <xref target="RFC6660"/> and the default
            encapsulation and decapsulation rules <xref target="RFC6040"/> are
            compatible with this interpretation of the ECN field. <vspace
            blankLines="1"/>If the arriving inner header is an ECN-PDU, where
            the inner and outer headers carry indications of congestion of
            different severity, the more severe indication SHOULD be forwarded
            in preference to the less severe.</t>

            <t>The inner and outer headers might carry a combination of
            congestion notification fields that should not be possible given
            any currently used protocol transitions. For instance, if
            Encapsulation Guideline <xref format="counter"
            target="ecnencap_Encap_Copy"/> in <xref
            target="ecnencap_EncapGuidelines"/> had been followed, it should
            not be possible to have a less severe indication of congestion in
            the outer than in the inner. It MAY be appropriate to log
            unexpected combinations of headers and possibly raise an alarm.
            <vspace blankLines="1"/>If a safe outgoing codepoint can be
            defined for such a PDU, the PDU SHOULD be forwarded rather than
            dropped. Some implementers discard PDUs with currently unused
            combinations of headers just in case they represent an attack.
            However, an approach using alarms and policy-mediated drop is
            preferable to hard-coded drop, so that operators can keep track of
            possible attacks but currently unused combinations are not
            precluded from future use through new standards actions.</t>

        <t>In some deployments, particularly in 3GPP networks, an IP packet
        may traverse two or more IP-in-IP tunnels in sequence that all use
        identical technology (e.g. GTP).</t>

        <t>In such cases, it would be sufficient for every encapsulation and
        decapsulation in the chain to comply with RFC 6040. Alternatively, as
        an optimisation, a node that decapsulates a packet and immediately
        re-encapsulates it for the next tunnel MAY copy the incoming outer ECN
        field directly to the outgoing outer and the incoming inner ECN field
        directly to the outgoing inner. Then the overall behavior across the
        sequence of tunnel segments would still be consistent with RFC
        6040.</t>

        <t>Appendix C of RFC6040 describes how a tunnel egress can monitor how
        much congestion has been introduced within a tunnel. A network
        operator might want to monitor how much congestion had been introduced
        within a whole sequence of tunnels. Using the technique in Appendix C
        of RFC6040 at the final egress, the operator could monitor the whole
        sequence of tunnels, but only if the above optimisation were used
        consistently along the sequence of tunnels, in order to make it appear
        as a single tunnel. Therefore, tunnel endpoint implementations SHOULD
        allow the operator to configure whether this optimisation is
        enabled.</t>

      <section anchor="ecnencap_Reframing"
               title="Reframing and Congestion Markings">
        <t>The guidance in this section is worded in terms of framing
        boundaries, but it applies equally whether the protocol data units are
        frames, cells, packets or fragments.</t>

        <t>Where an AQM marks the ECN field of IP packets as they queue into a
        layer-2 link, there will be no problem with framing boundaries,
        because the ECN markings would be applied directly to IP packets. The
        guidance in this section is only applicable where an ECN capability is
        being added to a layer-2 protocol so that layer-2 frames can be
        ECN-marked by an AQM at layer-2. This would only be necessary where
        AQM will be applied at pure layer-2 nodes (without IP-awareness).
        Where framing boundaries do not necessarily align with packet
        boundaries, the following guidance will be needed. It explains how to
        propagate ECN markings from layer-2 frame headers when they are
        stripped off and IP PDUs with different boundaries are reassembled for
        forwarding.</t>

        <t>Congestion indications SHOULD be propagated on the basis that an
        encapsulator or decapsulator SHOULD approximately preserve the
        proportion of PDUs with congestion indications arriving and
        leaving.</t>

        <t>The mechanism for propagating congestion indications SHOULD ensure
        that any incoming congestion indication is propagated immediately, not
        held awaiting the possibility of further congestion indications to be
        sufficient to indicate congestion on an outgoing PDU.</t>

    <section anchor="ecnencap_Guidelines_Up"

      <t>The guidance in this section is applicable, for example, when IP
      packets:<list style="symbols">
          <t>are encapsulated in Ethernet headers, which have no support for
          ECN;</t>

          <t>are forwarded by the eNode-B (base station) of a 3GPP radio
          access network, which is required to apply ECN marking during
          congestion, <xref target="LTE-RA"/>, <xref target="UTRAN"/>, but the
          Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) that encapsulates the IP
          header over the radio access has no support for ECN.</t>
        </list>This guidance also generalizes to encapsulation by other subnet
      technologies with no native support for explicit congestion notification
      at the lower layer, but with support for finding and processing an IP
      header. It is unlikely to be applicable or necessary for IP-in-IP
      encapsulation, where feed-forward-and-up mode based on <xref
      target="RFC6040"/> would be more appropriate.</t>

      <t>Marking the IP header while switching at layer-2 (by using a layer-3
      switch) or while forwarding in a radio access network seems to represent
      a layering violation. However, it can be considered as a benign
      optimisation if the guidelines below are followed. Feed-up-and-forward
      is certainly not a general alternative to implementing feed-forward
      congestion notification in the lower layer, because:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>IPv4 and IPv6 are not the only layer-3 protocols that might be

          <t>Link-layer encryption might be in use, making the layer-2 payload
          inaccessible</t>

          <t>Many Ethernet switches do not have 'layer-3 switch' capabilities
          so they cannot read or modify an IP payload</t>

          <t>It might be costly to find an IP header (v4 or v6) when it may be
          encapsulated by more than one lower layer header, e.g. Ethernet MAC
          in MAC (<xref target="IEEE802.1Q"/>; previously 802.1ah).</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Nonetheless, configuring lower layer equipment to look for an ECN
      field in an encapsulated IP header is a useful optimisation. If the
      implementation follows the guidelines below, this optimisation does not
      have to be confined to a controlled environment such as within a data
      centre; it could usefully be applied on any network&mdash;even if the
      operator is not sure whether the above issues will never apply:<list
          style="numbers">
          <t>If a native lower-layer congestion notification mechanism exists
          for a subnet technology, it is safe to mix feed-up-and-forward with

          it will generally be more efficient to use the native mechanism.</t>

          <t>The depth of the search for an IP header SHOULD be limited. If an
          IP header is not found soon enough, or an unrecognized or unreadable
          header is encountered, the switch SHOULD resort to an alternative
          means of signalling congestion (e.g. drop, or the native lower layer
          mechanism if available).</t>

          <t>It is sufficient to use the first IP header found in the stack;
          the egress of the relevant tunnel can propagate congestion
          notification upwards to any more deeply encapsulated IP headers
          later.</t>

    <section anchor="ecnencap_Guidelines_Backward"
             title="Feed-Backward Mode: Guidelines for Adding Congestion Notification">
      <t>It can be seen from <xref target="ecnencap_Backward"/> that
      congestion notification in a subnet using feed-backward mode has
      generally not been designed to be directly coupled with IP layer
      congestion notification. The subnet attempts to minimize congestion
      internally, and if the incoming load at the ingress exceeds the capacity
      somewhere through the subnet, the layer 3 buffer into the ingress backs
      up. Thus, a feed-backward mode subnet is in some sense similar to a null
      mode subnet, in that there is no need for any direct interaction between
      the subnet and higher layer congestion notification. Therefore no
      detailed protocol design guidelines are appropriate. Nonetheless, a more
      general guideline is appropriate: <list style="empty">
          <t>A subnetwork technology intended to eventually interface to IP
          SHOULD NOT be designed using only the feed-backward mode, which is
          certainly best for a stand-alone subnet, but would need to be
          modified to work efficiently as part of the wider Internet, because
          IP uses feed-forward-and-up mode.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The feed-backward approach at least works beneath IP, where the term
      'works' is used only in a narrow functional sense because feed-backward
      can result in very inefficient and sluggish congestion
      control&mdash;except if it is confined to the subnet directly connected
      to the original data source, when it is faster than feed-forward. It
      would be valid to design a protocol that could work in feed-backward
      mode for paths that only cross one subnet, and in feed-forward-and-up
      mode for paths that cross subnets.</t>

      <t>In the early days of TCP/IP, a similar feed-backward approach was
      tried for explicit congestion signalling, using source-quench (SQ) ICMP
      control packets. However, SQ fell out of favour and is now formally
      deprecated <xref target="RFC6633"/>. The main problem was that it is
      hard for a data source to tell the difference between a spoofed SQ
      message and a quench request from a genuine buffer on the path. It is
      also hard for a lower layer buffer to address an SQ message to the
      original source port number, which may be buried within many layers of
      headers, and possibly encrypted.</t>

      <t>QCN (also known as backward congestion notification, BCN; see
      Sections 30--33 of <xref target="IEEE802.1Q"/>; previously known as
      802.1Qau) uses a feed-backward mode structurally similar to ATM's
      relative rate mechanism. However, QCN confines its applicability to
      scenarios such as some data centres where all endpoints are directly
      attached by the same Ethernet technology. If a QCN subnet were later
      connected into a wider IP-based internetwork (e.g. when attempting to
      interconnect multiple data centres) it would suffer the inefficiency
      shown in <xref target="ecnencap_Fig_Feed-Backward"/>.</t>

      <!--{ToDo - either make this a separate case, move it to modes, or delete it} 
In some circumstances (e.g. pseudowire emulations with link-local flow control), the whole 
path is divided into segments, each with its own congestion notification and feedback loop. 
In these cases, the function that regulates load at the start of each segment will need to 
reset congestion notification (i.e. clear any accumulated congestion notifications) at the 
start of its segment.-->

    <section anchor="ecnencap_Security_Considerations"
             title="Security Considerations">
      <t>If a lower layer wire protocol is redesigned to include explicit
      congestion signalling in-band in the protocol header, care SHOULD be
      take to ensure that the field used is specified as mutable during
      transit. Otherwise interior nodes signalling congestion would invalidate
      any authentication protocol applied to the lower layer header&mdash;by
      altering a header field that had been assumed as immutable.</t>

      <t>The redesign of protocols that encapsulate IP in order to propagate
      congestion signals between layers raises potential signal integrity
      concerns. Experimental or proposed approaches exist for assuring the
      end-to-end integrity of in-band congestion signals, e.g.:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Congestion exposure (ConEx ) for networks to audit that their
          congestion signals are not being suppressed by other networks or by
          receivers, and for networks to police that senders are responding
          sufficiently to the signals, irrespective of the L4 transport
          protocol used <xref target="RFC7713"/>.</t>

          <t>A test for a sender to detect whether a network or the receiver
          is suppressing congestion signals (for example see 2nd para of
          Section 20.2 of <xref target="RFC3168"/>).</t>
        </list>Given these end-to-end approaches are already being specified,
      it would make little sense to attempt to design hop-by-hop congestion
      signal integrity into a new lower layer protocol, because end-to-end
      integrity inherently achieves hop-by-hop integrity.</t>

      spoofing as one of the reasons for deprecating feed-backward mode.</t>

    <section anchor="ecnencap_Conclusions" title="Conclusions">
      <t>Following the guidance in this document enables ECN support to be
      extended to numerous protocols that encapsulate IP (v4 &amp; v6) in a
      consistent way, so that IP continues to fulfil its role as an end-to-end
      interoperability layer. This includes:<list style="symbols">
          <t>A wide range of tunnelling protocols including those with various
          forms of shim header between two IP headers, possibly also separated
          by a L2 header;</t>

          <t>A wide range of subnet technologies, particularly those that work
          in the same 'feed-forward-and-up' mode that is used to support ECN
          in IP and MPLS.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>Guidelines have been defined for supporting propagation of ECN
      between Ethernet and IP on so-called Layer-3 Ethernet switches, using a
      'feed-up-and-forward' mode. This approach could enable other subnet
      technologies to pass ECN signals into the IP layer, even if they do not
      support ECN natively.</t>

      <t>Finally, attempting to add ECN to a subnet technology in
      feed-backward mode is deprecated except in special cases, due to its
      likely sluggish response to congestion.</t>

                  <t>Scope: Clarified that the specification of alternative
                  ECN semantics using ECT(1) was not in RFC 4774, but rather
                  in RFC 8311, and that the problem with using a DSCP to
                  indicate alternative semantics has issues at domain
                  boundaries as well as tunnels.</t>

                  <t>Terminology: tighted up definitions of ECN-PDU and
                  Not-ECN-PDU, and removed definition of Congestion Baseline,
                  given it was only used once.</t>

                  <t>Mentioned QCN where feed-backward is first introduced
                  (S.3), referring forward to where it is discussed more
                  deeply (S.4).</t>

                  <t>Clarified that IS-IS solution to adding ECN support to
                  TRILL was not pursued</t>

                  <t>Completely rewrote the rationale for the guideline about
                  a Standard Congestion Monitoring Baseline, to focus on
                  standardization of the otherwise unknown scenario used,
                  rather than the relative usefulness of the info in each
                  approach</t>

                  <t>Explained the re-framing problem better and added
                  fragmentation as another possible cause of the problem</t>

                  <t>Acknowledged new reviewers</t>

                  <t>Updated references, replaced citations of 802.1Qau and
                  802.1ah with rolled up 802.1Q, and added citations of Fat
                  trees and Clos Networks</t>

              <t>Removed short section (was 3) 'Guidelines for All Cases'
              because it was out of scope, being covered by RFC 4774. Expanded
              the Scope section (1.2) to explain all this. Explained that the
              default encap/decap rules already support certain alternative
              semantics, particularly all three of the alternative semantics
              for ECT(1): equivalent to ECT(0) , higher severity than ECT(0),
