      <t>RFC 6040 on "Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification" made the
      rules for propagation of ECN consistent for all forms of IP in IP
      tunnel. This specification updates RFC 6040 to clarify that its scope
      includes tunnels where two IP headers are separated by at least one shim
      header that is not sufficient on its own for wide area packet
      forwarding. It surveys widely deployed IP tunnelling protocols separated
      by such shim header(s) and updates the specifications of those that do
      not mention ECN propagation (L2TPv2, L2TPv3, GRE and Teredo). This
      specification also updates RFC 6040 with configuration requirements
      needed to make any legacy tunnel ingress safe. </t>

    <section anchor="rfc6040up_Introduction" title="Introduction">
      <t>RFC 6040 on "Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification" <xref
      target="RFC6040"/> made the rules for propagation of Explicit Congestion
      Notification (ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/>) consistent for all forms of
      IP in IP tunnel.</t>

      <t>A common pattern for many tunnelling protocols is to encapsulate an
      inner IP header (v4 or v6) with shim header(s) then an outer IP header
      (v4 or v6). Some of these shim headers are designed as generic
      encapsulations, so they do not necessarily directly encapsulate an inner
      IP header. Instead they can encapsulate headers such as link-layer (L2)
      protocols that in turn often encapsulate IP.</t>

      <t>To clear up confusion, this specification clarifies that the scope of
      RFC 6040 includes any IP-in-IP tunnel, including those with shim
      header(s) and other encapsulations between the IP headers. Where
      necessary, it updates the specifications of the relevant encapsulation
      protocols with the specific text necessary to comply with RFC 6040.</t>

      <t>This specification also updates RFC 6040 to state how operators ought
      to configure a legacy tunnel ingress to avoid unsafe system
      configurations.</t>
    </section>

    <!-- ================================================================ -->

    <section anchor="rfc6040up_Reqs_Language" title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref
      target="RFC2119"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
      shown here.</t>

      <t>This specification uses the terminology defined in RFC 6040 <xref
      target="RFC6040"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="rfc6040up_scope" title="Scope of RFC 6040">
      <t>In section 1.1 of RFC 6040, its scope is defined as: <list
          style="empty">
          <t>"...ECN field processing at encapsulation and decapsulation for
          any IP-in-IP tunnelling, whether IPsec or non-IPsec tunnels. It
          applies irrespective of whether IPv4 or IPv6 is used for either the
          inner or outer headers. ..."</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>This was intended to include cases where shim header(s) sit between
      the IP headers. Many tunnelling implementers have interpreted the scope
      of RFC 6040 as it was intended, but it is ambiguous. Therefore, this
      specification updates RFC 6040 by adding the following scoping text
      after the sentences quoted above:<list style="empty">
          <t>It applies in cases where an outer IP header encapsulates an
          inner IP header either directly or indirectly by encapsulating other
          headers that in turn encapsulate (or might encapsulate) an inner IP
          header.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>There is another problem with the scope of RFC 6040. Like many IETF
      specifications, RFC 6040 is written as a specification that
      implementations can choose to claim compliance with. This means it does
      not cover two important cases:<list style="numbers">
          <t>those cases where it is infeasible for an implementation to
          access an inner IP header when adding or removing an outer IP
          header;</t>

          <t>those implementations that choose not to propagate ECN between IP
          headers.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>However, the ECN field is a non-optional part of the IP header (v4
      and v6). So any implementation that creates an outer IP header has to
      give the ECN field some value. There is only one safe value a tunnel
      ingress can use if it does not know whether the egress supports
      propagation of the ECN field; it has to zero the ECN field in any outer
      IP header. </t>

      <t>However, an RFC has no jurisdiction over implementations that choose
      not to comply with it or cannot comply with it, including all those
      implementations that pre-dated the RFC. Therefore it would have been
      unreasonable to add such a requirement to RFC 6040. Nonetheless, to
      ensure safe propagation of the ECN field over tunnels, it is reasonable
      to add requirements on operators, to ensure they configure their tunnels
      safely (where possible). Before stating these configuration requirements
      in <xref target="rfc6040up_sec_safe"/>, the factors that determine
      whether propagating ECN is feasible or desirable will be briefly
      introduced.</t>

      <section anchor="rfc6040up_feasibility"
               title="Feasibility of ECN Propagation between Tunnel Headers">
        <t>In many cases shim header(s) and an outer IP header are always
        added to (or removed from) an inner IP packet as part of the same
        procedure. We call this a tightly coupled shim header. Processing the
        shim and outer together is often necessary because the shim(s) are not
        sufficient for packet forwarding in their own right; not unless
        complemented by an outer header. In these cases it will often be
        feasible for an implementation to propagate the ECN field between the
        IP headers.</t>

        <t>In some cases a tunnel adds an outer IP header and a tightly
        coupled shim header to an inner header that is not an IP header, but
        that in turn encapsulates an IP header (or might encapsulate an IP
        header). For instance an inner Ethernet (or other link layer) header
        might encapsulate an inner IP header as its payload. We call this a
        tightly coupled shim over an encapsulating header.</t>

        <t>Digging to arbitrary depths to find an inner IP header within an
        encapsulation is strictly a layering violation so it cannot be a
        required behaviour. Nonetheless, some tunnel endpoints already look
        within a L2 header for an IP header, for instance to map the Diffserv
        codepoint between an encapsulated IP header and an outer IP header
        <xref target="RFC2983"/>. In such cases at least, it should be
        feasible to also (independently) propagate the ECN field between the
        same IP headers. Thus, access to the ECN field within an encapsulating
        header can be a useful and benign optimization. The guidelines in
        section 6 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-encap-guidelines"/> give
        the conditions for this layering violation to be benign. </t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="rfc6040up_desirability"
               title="Desirability of ECN Propagation between Tunnel Headers">
        <t>Developers and network operators are encouraged to implement and
        deploy tunnel endpoints compliant with RFC 6040 (as updated by the
        present specification) in order to provide the benefits of wider ECN
        deployment <xref target="RFC8087"/>. Nonetheless, propagation of ECN
        between IP headers, whether separated by shim headers or not, has to
        be optional to implement and to use, because:<list style="symbols">
            <t>Legacy implementations of tunnels without any ECN support
            already exist</t>

            <t>A network might be designed so that there is usually no
            bottleneck within the tunnel</t>

            <t>If the tunnel endpoints would have to search within an L2
            header to find an encapsulated IP header, it might not be worth
            the potential performance hit</t>
          </list></t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="rfc6040up_sec_safe"
             title="Making a non-ECN Tunnel Ingress Safe by Configuration">
      <t>Even when ECN propagation is not implemented or is not being used, it
      ought to be possible to render a tunnel ingress safe by configuration.
      The main safety concern is to disable the ECN capability in the outer IP
      header if the egress of the tunnel does not implement ECN logic to
      propagate any ECN markings into the packet forwarded beyond the tunnel.
      Otherwise the non-ECN egress could discard any ECN marking introduced
      within the tunnel, which would break all the ECN-based control loops
      that regulate the traffic load over the tunnel.</t>

      <t>Therefore this specification updates RFC 6040 by inserting the
      following text just before the last paragraph of section 4.3:<list
          style="empty">
          <t>When the implementation of a tunnel ingress does not support
          <xref target="RFC6040"/> or one of its compatible predecessors
          (<xref target="RFC4301"/> or the full functionality mode of <xref
          target="RFC3168"/>) and when the outer tunnel header is IP (v4 or
          v6), if possible, the operator MUST configure the ingress to zero
          the outer ECN field in any of the following cases:<list
              style="symbols">
              <t>if it is known that the tunnel egress does not support
              propagation of the ECN field (RFC 6040, RFC 4301 or the full
              functionality mode of RFC 3168)</t>

              <t>or if the behaviour of the egress is not known or an egress
              with unknown behaviour might be dynamically paired with the
              ingress.</t>

              <t>or if an IP header might be encapsulated within a non-IP
              header that the tunnel ingress is encapsulating, but the ingress
              does not inspect within the encapsulation.</t>
            </list></t>
        </list></t>

      <t>In order that the network operator can comply with the above safety
      rules, even if a tunnel ingress does not support RFC 6040, RFC 4301 or
      the full functionality mode of RFC 3168, the implementation of the
      tunnel ingress:<list style="symbols">
          <t>MUST make propagation of the ECN field between inner and outer IP
          headers independent of any configuration of Diffserv codepoint
          propagation;</t>

          <t>SHOULD zero the outer ECN field in its default configuration.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>There might be concern that the above "MUST" makes compliant
      equipment non-compliant at a stroke. However, any equipment that is
      still treating the ToS octet (IPv4) or the Traffic Class octet (IPv6) as
      a single 8-bit field is already non-compliant, and has been since 1998
      when the upper 6 bits were separated off for the Diffserv codepoint
      (DSCP) <xref target="RFC2474"/>. For instance, copying the ECN field as
      a side-effect of copying the DSCP is a seriously unsafe bug that risks
      breaking the feedback loops that regulate load on a tunnel.</t>

      <t>Permanently zeroing the outer ECN field is safe, but it is not
      sufficient to claim compliance with RFC 6040 because it does not meet
      the aim of introducing ECN support to tunnels (see Section 4.3 of <xref
      target="RFC6040"/>). </t>

      <t>Some of the listed protocols enable encapsulation of a variety of
      network layer protocols as inner and/or outer. This specification
      applies in the cases where there is an inner and outer IP header as
      described in <xref target="rfc6040up_scope"/>. Otherwise <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-encap-guidelines"/> gives guidance on how to
      design propagation of ECN into other protocols that might encapsulate
      IP.</t>

      <t>Where protocols in the above list need to be updated to specify ECN
      propagation and they are under IETF change control, update text is given
      in the following subsections. For those not under IETF control, it is
      RECOMMENDED that implementations of encapsulation and decapsulation
      comply with RFC 6040. It is also RECOMMENDED that their specifications
      are updated to add a requirement to comply with RFC 6040 (as updated by
      the present document).</t>

      <t>PPTP is not under the change control of the IETF, but it has been
      documented in an informational RFC <xref target="RFC2637"/>. However,
      there is no need for the present specification to update PPTP because
      L2TP has been developed as a standardized replacement.</t>

      <t>NVGRE is not under the change control of the IETF, but it has been
      documented in an informational RFC <xref target="RFC7637"/>. NVGRE is a
      specific use-case of GRE (it re-purposes the key field from the initial
      specification of GRE <xref target="RFC1701"/> as a Virtual Subnet ID).
      Therefore the text that updates GRE in <xref target="rfc6040up_GRE"/>
      below is also intended to update NVGRE.</t>

      <t>Although the definition of the various GTP shim headers is under the
      control of the 3GPP, it is hard to determine whether the 3GPP or the
      IETF controls standardization of the <spanx style="emph">process</spanx>
      of adding both a GTP and an IP header to an inner IP header.
      Nonetheless, the present specification is provided so that the 3GPP can
      refer to it from any of its own specifications of GTP and IP header
      processing.</t>

      <t>The specification of CAPWAP already specifies RFC 3168 ECN
      propagation and ECN capability negotiation. Without modification the
      CAPWAP specification already interworks with the backward compatible
      updates to RFC 3168 in RFC 6040.</t>

      <t>LISP made the ECN propagation procedures in RFC 3168 mandatory from
      the start. RFC 3168 has since been updated by RFC 6040, but the changes
      are backwards compatible so there is still no need for LISP tunnel
      endpoints to negotiate their ECN capabilities.</t>

      <t>VXLAN is not under the change control of the IETF but it has been
      documented in an informational RFC. In contrast, VXLAN-GPE (Generic
      Protocol Extension) is being documented under IETF change control. It is
      RECOMMENDED that VXLAN and VXLAN-GPE implementations comply with RFC
      6040 when the VXLAN header is inserted between (or removed from between)
      IP headers. The authors of any future update to these specifications are
      encouraged to add a requirement to comply with RFC 6040 as updated by
      the present specification.<!--{ToDo: Update this text once the VXLAN-GPE text has been updated.}--></t>

      <t>The specification of NSH does not currently include the process of
      encapsulation. It is assumed that ECN propagation will be included in
      whatever encapsulation an NSH implementation uses.</t>

      <t>The specifications of Geneve and GUE already refer to RFC 6040 for
      ECN encapsulation.</t>

          <t>The L2TP terminology used here is defined in <xref
          target="RFC2661"/> and <xref target="RFC3931"/>.</t>

          <t>L2TPv3 <xref target="RFC3931"/> is used as a shim header between
          any packet-switched network (PSN) header (e.g. IPv4, IPv6, MPLS) and
          many types of layer 2 (L2) header. The L2TPv3 shim header
          encapsulates an L2-specific sub-layer then an L2 header that is
          likely to contain an inner IP header (v4 or v6). Then this whole
          stack of headers can be encapsulated optionally within an outer UDP
          header then an outer PSN header that is typically IP (v4 or v6).</t>

          <t>L2TPv2 is used as a shim header between any PSN header and a PPP
          header, which is in turn likely to encapsulate an IP header.</t>

          <t>Even though these shims are rather fat (particularly in the case
          of L2TPv3), they still fit the definition of a tightly coupled shim
          header over an encapsulating header (<xref
          target="rfc6040up_feasibility"/>), because all the headers
          encapsulating the L2 header are added (or removed) together. L2TPv2
          and L2TPv3 are therefore within the scope of RFC 6040, as updated by
          <xref target="rfc6040up_scope"/> above.</t>

          <t>L2TP maintainers are RECOMMENDED to implement the ECN extension

                   title="ECN Extension for L2TP (v2 or v3)">
            <t>When the outer PSN header and the payload inside the L2 header
            are both IP (v4 or v6), to comply with RFC 6040, an LCCE will
            follow the rules for propagation of the ECN field at ingress and
            egress in Section 4 of RFC 6040 <xref target="RFC6040"/>.</t>

            <t>Before encapsulating any data packets, RFC 6040 requires an
            ingress LCCE to check that the egress LCCE supports ECN
            propagation. If the egress supports ECN, the ingress LCCE can use
            the normal mode of encapsulation. Otherwise, the ingress LCCE has
            to use compatibility mode <xref target="RFC6040"/>. An LCCE can
            determine the remote LCCE's support for ECN either statically (by
            configuration) or by dynamic discovery during setup of each
            control connection between the LCCEs, using the Capability AVP
            defined in <xref target="rfc6040up_L2TP_Capability_AVP"/>
            below.</t>

            <t>Where the outer PSN header is some protocol other than IP that
            supports ECN, the appropriate ECN propagation specification will
            need to be followed, e.g. "Explicit Congestion Marking in MPLS"
            <xref target="RFC5129"/>. Where no specification exists for ECN
            propagation by a particular PSN, <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-encap-guidelines"/> gives general
            guidance on how to design ECN propagation into a protocol that
            encapsulates IP.</t>

            <section anchor="rfc6040up_L2TP_Capability_AVP"
                     title="LCCE Capability AVP for ECN Capability Negotiation">
              <t>The LCCE Capability Attribute Value Pair (AVP) defined here
              has Attribute Type ZZ. The Attribute Value field for this AVP is
              a bit-mask with the following 16-bit format:</t>

              <figure>
                <artwork><![CDATA[       0                   1

      |X X X X X X X X X X X X X X X E|
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+]]></artwork>
              </figure>

              <t>This AVP MAY be present in the following message types: SCCRQ
              and SCCRP (Start-Control-Connection-Request and
              Start-Control-Connection-Reply). This AVP MAY be hidden (the
              H-bit set to 0 or 1) and is optional (M-bit not set). The length
              (before hiding) of this AVP MUST be 8 octets. The Vendor ID is
              the IETF Vendor ID of 0.</t>

              <t>Bit 15 of the Value field of the LCCE Capability AVP is
              defined as the ECN Capability flag (E). When the ECN Capability
              flag is set to 1, it indicates that the sender supports ECN
              propagation. When the ECN Capability flag is cleared to zero, or
              when no LCCE Capabiliy AVP is present, it indicates that the
              sender does not support ECN propagation. All the other bits are
              reserved. They MUST be cleared to zero when sent and ignored
              when received or forwarded.</t>

              <t>An LCCE initiating a control connection will send a
              Start-Control-Connection-Request (SCCRQ) containing an LCCE
              Capability AVP with the ECN Capability flag set to 1. If the
              tunnel terminator supports ECN, it will return a
              Start-Control-Connection-Reply (SCCRP) that also includes an
              LCCE Capability AVP with the ECN Capability flag set to 1. Then,
              for any sessions created by that control connection, both ends
              of the tunnel can use the normal mode of RFC 6040 to propagate
              the ECN field when encapsulating data packets.</t>

              <t>If, on the other hand, the tunnel terminator does not support
              ECN it will ignore the ECN flag in the LCCE Capability AVP and
              send an SCCRP to the tunnel initiator without a Capability AVP
              (or with a Capability AVP but with the ECN Capability flag
              cleared to zero). The tunnel initiator interprets the absence of
              the ECN Capability flag in the SCCRP as an indication that the
              tunnel terminator is incapable of supporting ECN. When
              encapsulating data packets for any sessions created by that
              control connection, the tunnel initiator will then use the
              compatibility mode of RFC 6040 to clear the ECN field of the
              outer IP header to 0b00.</t>

              <t>If the tunnel terminator does not support this ECN extension,
              the network operator is still expected to configure it to comply
              with the safety provisions set out in <xref
              target="rfc6040up_L2TP_Safe"/> above, when it acts as an ingress
              LCCE.</t>

          <t>The GRE terminology used here is defined in <xref
          target="RFC2784"/>. GRE is often used as a tightly coupled shim
          header between IP headers. Sometimes the GRE shim header
          encapsulates an L2 header, which might in turn encapsulate an IP
          header. Therefore GRE is within the scope of RFC 6040 as updated by
          <xref target="rfc6040up_scope"/> above.</t>

          <t>GRE tunnel endpoint maintainers are RECOMMENDED to support <xref
          target="RFC6040"/> as updated by the present specification, in order
          to provide the benefits of ECN <xref target="RFC8087"/> whenever a
          node within a GRE tunnel becomes the bottleneck for an end-to-end IP
          traffic flow tunnelled over GRE using IP as the delivery protocol
          (outer header).</t>

          <t>GRE tunnels do not support dynamic configuration based on
          capability negotiation, so the ECN capability has to be manually
          configured. For a GRE ingress implementation that supports ECN
          propagation, manual configuration requirements are specified in
          Section 4.3 of RFC 6040. Otherwise they are specified in <xref
          target="rfc6040up_GRE_Safe"/> below. </t>

          <t>Where the delivery protocol is some protocol other than IP that
          supports ECN, the appropriate ECN propagation specification will
          need to be followed, e.g Explicit Congestion Marking in MPLS <xref

        <section title="Teredo">
          <t>Teredo <xref target="RFC4380"/> provides a way to tunnel IPv6
          over an IPv4 network, with a UDP-based shim header between the
          two.</t>

          <t>For Teredo tunnel endpoints to provide the benefits of ECN, the
          Teredo specification would have to be updated to include negotiation
          of the ECN capability between Teredo tunnel endpoints. Otherwise it
          would be unsafe for a Teredo tunnel ingress to copy the ECN field to
          the IPv6 outer.</t>

          <t>It is believed that current implementations do not support
          propagation of ECN, but that they do safely zero the ECN field in
          the outer IPv6 header. However the specification does not mention
          anything about this. To make existing Teredo deployments safe it
          will not be feasible to require them to be configured correctly,
          because Teredo tunnel endpoints are generally deployed on hosts.
          Therefore, the only feasible safety precaution available here is to
          update the specification of Teredo implementations until ECN support
          is added. The following text updates the Teredo specification <xref
          target="RFC4380"/>, as a new section 5.1.3:<list style="empty">
