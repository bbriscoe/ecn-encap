      <t>RFC 6040 on "Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification" made the
      rules for propagation of ECN consistent for all forms of IP in IP
      tunnel. This specification extends the scope of RFC 6040 to include
      tunnels where two IP headers are separated by at least one shim header
      that is not sufficient on its own for packet forwarding.</t>

    <section anchor="ecnencap_Introduction" title="Scope of RFC 6040">
      <t>RFC 6040 on "Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification" <xref
      target="RFC6040"/> made the rules for propagation of Explicit Congestion
      Notification (ECN <xref target="RFC3168"/>) consistent for all forms of
      IP in IP tunnel. The scope of RFC 6040 was stated as <list style="empty">
          <t>"...ECN field processing at encapsulation and decapsulation for
          any IP-in-IP tunnelling, whether IPsec or non-IPsec tunnels. It
          applies irrespective of whether IPv4 or IPv6 is used for either the
          inner or outer headers. ..."</t>
        </list>A common pattern for many tunnelling protocols is to
      encapsulate an inner IP header with shim header(s) then an outer IP
      header. To clear up confusion, this specification clarifies that the
      scope of RFC 6040 includes any IP-in-IP tunnel, including those with
      shim header(s) between the IP headers.</t>

      <t>Propagation of ECN between tunnelled IP headers is related to
      propagation of the Diffserv field over tunnels <xref target="RFC2983"/>.
      However, unlike Diffserv, no configuration knobs are required, because
      the network operator has no choices over propagation of the ECN field,
      which has end-to-end semantics.</t>

      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref

      shown here.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="ecnencap_IP-IP_Coupled_Shim_Tunnels"
             title="IP-in-IP Tunnels with Tightly Coupled Shim Headers">
      <t>In many cases the shim header(s) and the outer IP header are always
      added (or removed) as part of the same process. We call this a tightly
      coupled shim header. Processing the shim and outer together is often
      necessary because the shim(s) are not sufficient for packet forwarding
      in their own right; not unless complemented by an outer header.</t>

      <t>For all such tightly coupled shim headers, the rules in <xref
      target="RFC6040"/> for propagating the ECN field MUST be applied between
      the inner and outer IP headers. The above is written as a 'MUST' because
      RFC 6040 allows a compatibility mode for the encapsulator in cases where
      the decapsulator does not (or cannot) support ECN propagation. In the
      compatibility mode, the outer ECN field is cleared to zero.</t>

      <t>There follows a list of encapsulations with tightly coupled shim
      header(s). The list is not necessarily exhaustive, so the above
      requirement applies to all tightly coupled shim headers whether or not
      they are listed here.</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>L2TPv2 <xref target="RFC2661"/>, L2TPv3 <xref
          target="RFC3931"/></t>

          <t>VXLAN <xref target="RFC7348"/>.</t>

          <!--{ToDo: Check that all the above are always tightly coupled to the IP outer.}
{ToDo: More examples - remember to add to 'Updates' header too?}-->
        </list></t>

      <t>Geneve <xref target="I-D.ietf-nvo3-geneve"/> and Generic UDP
      Encapsulation (GUE) <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-gue"/> are also
      tightly coupled shim headers, but their specifications already refer to
      RFC 6040 for ECN encapsulation.</t>

      <t>Some of the listed protocols enable encapsulation of a variety of
      network layer protocols as inner and/or outer. This specification
      applies when the inner and outer are both IP (v4 or v6). More generally,
      whatever form IP-in-IP tunnelling takes, the ECN field SHOULD be
      propagated according to the rules in RFC 6040 wherever possible.
      Otherwise <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-encap-guidelines"/> gives
      more general guidance on how to propagate ECN to and from protocols that
      encapsulate IP.</t>

      <t>Specific update text for those protocols in the above list that are
      under IETF change control is given in <xref
      target="ecnencap_rfc-updates"/>. For those not under IETF control, it is
      RECOMMENDED that implementations of encapsulation and decapsulation
      comply with RFC 6040. It is also RECOMMENDED that their specifications
      are updated to add a requirement to comply with RFC 6040.</t>

      <t>Although the definition of the various GTP shim headers is under the
      control of the 3GPP, it is hard to determine whether the 3GPP or the
      IETF controls standardization of the <spanx style="emph">process</spanx>
      of adding both a GTP and an IP header to an inner IP header.
      Nonetheless, the present specification is provided so that the 3GPP can
      refer to it from any of its own specifications of GTP and IP header
      processing.</t>

      <t>PPTP is not under the change control of the IETF, but it has been
      documented in an informational RFC <xref target="RFC2637"/>. However,
      there is no need for this memo to update PPTP because L2TP has been
      developed as a standardized replacement.</t>

      <t>NVGRE is not under the change control of the IETF, but it has been
      documented in an informational RFC <xref target="RFC7637"/>. NVGRE is a
      specific use-case of GRE (it re-purposes the key field from the initial
      specification of GRE <xref target="RFC1701"/> as a Virtual Subnet ID).
      Therefore the text that updates GRE below is also intended to update
      NVGRE. </t>

      <t>VXLAN is not under the change control of the IETF but it has been
      documented in an informational RFC. It is RECOMMENDED that VXLAN
      implementations comply with RFC 6040 when the VXLAN header is inserted
      between (or removed from between) IP headers. And the authors of any
      future update to these specifications are encouraged to add a
      requirement to comply with RFC 6040.</t>

      <t/>

      <section anchor="rfc6040up_L2TPv3" title="L2TPv3">
        <t>L2TPv3 <xref target="RFC3931"/> can be used as a shim header that
        encapsulates an L2-specific sub-layer then an L2 header containing an
        inner IP header (v4 or v6). Then this whole stack of headers can be
        encapsulated optionally within an outer UDP header then an outer IP
        header (v4 or v6). Even though this shim is rather fat, it still fits
        the definition of a tightly coupled shim header, because all the
        headers are added (or removed) together.</t>

        <t>ECN propagation is defined here as an update to L2TPv3 itself,
        because the ECN field in IP has end-to-end semantics with no operator
        choice. In contrast, Diffserv handling was defined as an extension to
        L2TP<xref target="RFC3308"> </xref> because the operator of the tunnel
        determines whether and how Diffserv is handled. This memo updates the
        specification of L2TPv3 <xref target="RFC3931"/> as follows:</t>

        <t>Append the following text to Section 4.5 of <xref
        target="RFC3931"/>:<list style="empty">
            <t>"When the payload inside the L2 header and the outer PSN header
            are both IP (v4 or v6), the ECN field MUST be propagated between
            these IP headers according to the rules in Section 4 of RFC 6040
            <xref target="RFC6040"/>. ECN propagation occurs both when the
            packet is encapsulated and when it is decapsulated.</t>

            <t>Before encapsulating any data packets, these rules require an
            LCCE to check that the remote LCCE supports ECN propagation. If it
            does, the normal mode of encapsulation can be used, otherwise the
            compatibility mode is required <xref target="RFC6040"/>. An LCCE
            can determine the remote LCCE's support for ECN either statically
            (by configuration) or by dynamic discovery during setup of each
            control connection between the LCCEs, using the ECN AVP defined
            below.</t>

            <t>Where the outer PSN header is some protocol other than IP that
            supports ECN, the appropriate ECN propagation specification will
            need to be followed, e.g Explicit Congestion Marking in MPLS <xref
            target="RFC5129"/>. Where no specification exists for ECN
            propagation by particular PSN, <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-encap-guidelines"/> gives more general
            guidance on how to propagate ECN to and from protocols that
            encapsulate IP."</t>
          </list></t>

        <t>Append the following text to the list of Control Connection AVPs
        (Attribute Value Pairs) in Section 5.4.3 of <xref
        target="RFC3931"/>:<list style="empty">
            <t>"ECN Capability (SCCRQ, SCCRP)<list style="empty">
                <t>The ECN Capability AVP, Attribute Type ZZ, declares that
                the sender of the AVP supports propagation of ECN. An LCCE
                initiating a control connection will send a
                Start-Control-Connection-Request (SCCRQ) containing the ECN
                AVP. If the tunnel terminator supports ECN, it will return a
                Start-Control-Connection-Reply (SCCRP) that also includes the
                ECN AVP. Then both ends of the tunnel can use the normal mode
                of RFC 6040 to propagate the ECN field when encapsulating data
                packets for any sessions created by that control
                connection.</t>

                <t>If, on the other hand, the tunnel terminator does not
                support ECN it will ignore the ECN AVP and send an SCCRP to
                the tunnel initiator without the ECN AVP. The tunnel initiator
                interprets the absence of the ECN AVP in the SCCRP as an
                indication that the tunnel terminator is incapable of
                supporting ECN. When encapsulating data packets for any
                sessions created by that control connection, it will then use
                the compatibility mode of RFC 6040 to clear the ECN field of
                the outer IP header. </t>

                <t>If there is no ECN AVP in an arriving control connection
                request (SCCRQ), a tunnel terminator MUST NOT include the ECN
                APV in its reply (SCCRP).</t>

                <t>The Attribute Value field for this AVP is a bit-mask with
                the following format:<figure>
