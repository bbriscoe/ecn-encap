      <t>RFC 6040 on "Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification" made the
      rules for propagation of ECN consistent for all forms of IP in IP
      tunnel. This specification updates RFC 6040 to clarify that its scope
      includes tunnels where two IP headers are separated by at least one shim
      header that is not sufficient on its own for wide area packet
      forwarding. It surveys widely deployed IP tunnelling protocols that use
      such shim header(s) and updates the specifications of those that do not
      mention ECN propagation (L2TPv2, L2TPv3, GRE, Teredo and AMT). This
      specification also updates RFC 6040 with configuration requirements
      needed to make any legacy tunnel ingress safe.</t>

      <t>RFC 6040 on "Tunnelling of Explicit Congestion Notification" <xref target="RFC6040" format="default"/> made the rules for propagation of Explicit Congestion
      Notification (ECN <xref target="RFC3168" format="default"/>) consistent for all forms of
      IP in IP tunnel.</t>
      <t>A common pattern for many tunnelling protocols is to encapsulate an
      inner IP header (v4 or v6) with shim header(s) then an outer IP header
      (v4 or v6). Some of these shim headers are designed as generic
      encapsulations, so they do not necessarily directly encapsulate an inner
      IP header. Instead they can encapsulate headers such as link-layer (L2)
      protocols that in turn often encapsulate IP.</t>
      <t>To clear up confusion, this specification clarifies that the scope of
      RFC 6040 includes any IP-in-IP tunnel, including those with shim
      header(s) and other encapsulations between the IP headers. Where
      necessary, it updates the specifications of the relevant encapsulation
      protocols with the specific text necessary to comply with RFC 6040.</t>
      <t>This specification also updates RFC 6040 to state how operators ought
      to configure a legacy tunnel ingress to avoid unsafe system
      configurations.</t>

    <section anchor="rfc6040up_Reqs_Language" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Terminology</name>
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 <xref target="RFC2119" format="default"/> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
      shown here.</t>
      <t>This specification uses the terminology defined in RFC 6040 <xref target="RFC6040" format="default"/>.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="rfc6040up_scope" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Scope of RFC 6040</name>
      <t>In section 1.1 of RFC 6040, its scope is defined as: </t>
      <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
        <li>"...ECN field processing at encapsulation and decapsulation for
          any IP-in-IP tunnelling, whether IPsec or non-IPsec tunnels. It
          applies irrespective of whether IPv4 or IPv6 is used for either the
          inner or outer headers. ..."</li>
      </ul>
      <t>This was intended to include cases where shim header(s) sit between
      the IP headers. Many tunnelling implementers have interpreted the scope
      of RFC 6040 as it was intended, but it is ambiguous. Therefore, this
      specification updates RFC 6040 by adding the following scoping text
      after the sentences quoted above:</t>
      <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
        <li>It applies in cases where an outer IP header encapsulates an
          inner IP header either directly or indirectly by encapsulating other
          headers that in turn encapsulate (or might encapsulate) an inner IP
          header.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>There is another problem with the scope of RFC 6040. Like many IETF
      specifications, RFC 6040 is written as a specification that
      implementations can choose to claim compliance with. This means it does
      not cover two important cases:</t>
      <ol spacing="normal" type="1"><li>those cases where it is infeasible for an implementation to
          access an inner IP header when adding or removing an outer IP
          header;</li>
        <li>those implementations that choose not to propagate ECN between IP
          headers.</li>
      </ol>
      <t>However, the ECN field is a non-optional part of the IP header (v4
      and v6). So any implementation that creates an outer IP header has to
      give the ECN field some value. There is only one safe value a tunnel
      ingress can use if it does not know whether the egress supports
      propagation of the ECN field; it has to clear the ECN field in any outer
      IP header to 0b00.</t>
      <t>However, an RFC has no jurisdiction over implementations that choose
      not to comply with it or cannot comply with it, including all those
      implementations that pre-dated the RFC. Therefore it would have been
      unreasonable to add such a requirement to RFC 6040. Nonetheless, to
      ensure safe propagation of the ECN field over tunnels, it is reasonable
      to add requirements on operators, to ensure they configure their tunnels
      safely (where possible). Before stating these configuration requirements
      in <xref target="rfc6040up_sec_safe" format="default"/>, the factors that determine
      whether propagating ECN is feasible or desirable will be briefly
      introduced.</t>
      <section anchor="rfc6040up_feasibility" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Feasibility of ECN Propagation between Tunnel Headers</name>
        <t>In many cases shim header(s) and an outer IP header are always
        added to (or removed from) an inner IP packet as part of the same
        procedure. We call this a tightly coupled shim header. Processing the
        shim and outer together is often necessary because the shim(s) are not
        sufficient for packet forwarding in their own right; not unless
        complemented by an outer header. In these cases it will often be
        feasible for an implementation to propagate the ECN field between the
        IP headers.</t>
        <t>In some cases a tunnel adds an outer IP header and a tightly
        coupled shim header to an inner header that is not an IP header, but
        that in turn encapsulates an IP header (or might encapsulate an IP
        header). For instance an inner Ethernet (or other link layer) header
        might encapsulate an inner IP header as its payload. We call this a
        tightly coupled shim over an encapsulating header.</t>
        <t>Digging to arbitrary depths to find an inner IP header within an
        encapsulation is strictly a layering violation so it cannot be a
        required behaviour. Nonetheless, some tunnel endpoints already look
        within a L2 header for an IP header, for instance to map the Diffserv
        codepoint between an encapsulated IP header and an outer IP header
        <xref target="RFC2983" format="default"/>. In such cases at least, it should be
        feasible to also (independently) propagate the ECN field between the
        same IP headers. Thus, access to the ECN field within an encapsulating
        header can be a useful and benign optimization. The guidelines in
        section 5 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-tsvwg-ecn-encap-guidelines" format="default"/> give
        the conditions for this layering violation to be benign.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="rfc6040up_desirability" numbered="true" toc="default">
        <name>Desirability of ECN Propagation between Tunnel Headers</name>
        <t>Developers and network operators are encouraged to implement and
        deploy tunnel endpoints compliant with RFC 6040 (as updated by the
        present specification) in order to provide the benefits of wider ECN
        deployment <xref target="RFC8087" format="default"/>. Nonetheless, propagation of ECN
        between IP headers, whether separated by shim headers or not, has to
        be optional to implement and to use, because:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>Legacy implementations of tunnels without any ECN support
            already exist</li>
          <li>A network might be designed so that there is usually no
            bottleneck within the tunnel</li>
          <li>If the tunnel endpoints would have to search within an L2
            header to find an encapsulated IP header, it might not be worth
            the potential performance hit</li>

    <section anchor="rfc6040up_sec_safe" numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>Making a non-ECN Tunnel Ingress Safe by Configuration</name>
      <t>Even when no specific attempt has been made to implement propagation
      of the ECN field at a tunnel ingress, it ought to be possible for the
      operator to render a tunnel ingress safe by configuration. The main
      safety concern is to disable (clear to zero) the ECN capability in the
      outer IP header at the ingress if the egress of the tunnel does not
      implement ECN logic to propagate any ECN markings into the packet
      forwarded beyond the tunnel. Otherwise the non-ECN egress could discard
      any ECN marking introduced within the tunnel, which would break all the
      ECN-based control loops that regulate the traffic load over the
      tunnel.</t>
      <t>Therefore this specification updates RFC 6040 by inserting the
      following text at the end of section 4.3:</t>
      <ul empty="true" spacing="normal">
        <li>
          <t>"</t>
          <t>Whether or not an ingress implementation
          claims compliance with RFC 6040, RFC 4301 or RFC3168, when the outer
          tunnel header is IP (v4 or v6), if possible, the operator MUST
          configure the ingress to zero the outer ECN field in any of the
          following cases:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>if it is known that the tunnel egress does not support any of
              the RFCs that define propagation of the ECN field (RFC 6040, RFC
              4301 or the full functionality mode of RFC 3168)</li>
            <!--...from the outer to any forwarded IP header (which might be the forwarded header itself, or it might be encapsulated within a forwarded non-IP header).-->

              <li>or if the behaviour of the egress is not known or an egress
              with unknown behaviour might be dynamically paired with the
              ingress.</li>
            <li>or if an IP header might be encapsulated within a non-IP
              header that the tunnel ingress is encapsulating, but the ingress
              does not inspect within the encapsulation.</li>
            <!--Not sure this last bullet is needed. The above commented addition to the first bullet would be better.-->
            </ul>
          <t>For the avoidance of doubt, the above only concerns the
          outer IP header. The ingress MUST NOT alter the ECN field of the
          arriving IP header that will become the inner IP header.</t>
        </li>
        <li>
          <t>In order that the network operator can comply with the above
          safety rules, even if an implementation of a tunnel ingress does not
          claim to support RFC 6040, RFC 4301 or the full functionality mode
          of RFC 3168:</t>
          <ul spacing="normal">
            <li>it MUST NOT treat the former ToS octet (IPv4) or the former
              Traffic Class octet (IPv6) as a single 8-bit field, as the
              resulting linkage of ECN and Diffserv field propagation between
              inner and outer is not consistent with the definition of the
              6-bit Diffserv field in <xref target="RFC2474" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC3260" format="default"/>;</li>
            <li>it SHOULD be able to be configured to zero the ECN field of
              the outer header.</li>
          </ul>
          <t>"</t>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>For instance, if a tunnel ingress with no ECN-specific logic had a
      configuration capability to refer to the last 2 bits of the old ToS Byte
      of the outer (e.g. with a 0x3 mask) and set them to zero, while also
      being able to allow the DSCP to be re-mapped independently, that would
      be sufficient to satisfy both the above implementation requirements.</t>
      <t>There might be concern that the above "MUST NOT" makes compliant
      implementations non-compliant at a stroke. However, by definition it
      solely applies to equipment that provides Diffserv configuration. Any
      such Diffserv equipment that is configuring treatment of the former ToS
      octet (IPv4) or the former Traffic Class octet (IPv6) as a single 8-bit
      field must have always been non-compliant with the definition of the
      6-bit Diffserv field in <xref target="RFC2474" format="default"/> and <xref target="RFC3260" format="default"/>. If a tunnel ingress does not have any ECN logic,
      copying the ECN field as a side-effect of copying the DSCP is a
      seriously unsafe bug that risks breaking the feedback loops that
      regulate load on a tunnel.</t>
      <t>Zeroing the outer ECN field of all packets in all circumstances would
      be safe, but it would not be sufficient to claim compliance with RFC
      6040 because it would not meet the aim of introducing ECN support to
      tunnels (see Section 4.3 of <xref target="RFC6040" format="default"/>).</t>
    </section>
    <section numbered="true" toc="default">
      <name>ECN Propagation and Fragmentation/Reassembly</name>
      <t>The following requirements update RFC6040, which omitted handling of
      the ECN field during fragmentation or reassembly. These changes might
      alter how many ECN-marked packets are propagated by a tunnel that
      fragments packets, but this would not raise any backward compatibility
      issues:</t>
      <t>If a tunnel ingress fragments a packet, it MUST set the outer ECN
      field of all the fragments to the same value as it would have set if it
      had not fragmented the packet.</t>
      <t>Section 5.3 of <xref target="RFC3168" format="default"/> specifies ECN requirements
      for reassembly of sets of outer fragments <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-tunnels" format="default"/> into packets. The following two
      additional requirements apply at a tunnel egress:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>During reassembly of outer fragments <xref target="I-D.ietf-intarea-tunnels" format="default"/>, if the ECN fields of the outer

          discarded.</li>
        <li>If there is mix of ECT(0) and ECT(1) fragments, then the
          reassembled packet MUST be set to either ECT(0) or ECT(1). In this
          case, reassembly SHOULD take into account that the RFC series has so
          far ensured that ECT(0) and ECT(1) can either be considered
          equivalent, or they can provide 2 levels of congestion severity,
          where the ranking of severity from highest to lowest is CE, ECT(1),

      of adding both a GTP and an IP header to an inner IP header.
      Nonetheless, the present specification is provided so that the 3GPP can
      refer to it from any of its own specifications of GTP and IP header

      <t>The specification of CAPWAP already specifies RFC 3168 ECN
      propagation and ECN capability negotiation. Without modification the
      CAPWAP specification already interworks with the backward compatible
      updates to RFC 3168 in RFC 6040.</t>
      <t>LISP made the ECN propagation procedures in RFC 3168 mandatory from
      the start. RFC 3168 has since been updated by RFC 6040, but the changes
      are backwards compatible so there is still no need for LISP tunnel
      endpoints to negotiate their ECN capabilities.</t>
      <t>VXLAN is not under the change control of the IETF but it has been
      documented in an informational RFC. In contrast, VXLAN-GPE (Generic
      Protocol Extension) is being documented under IETF change control. It is
      RECOMMENDED that VXLAN and VXLAN-GPE implementations comply with RFC
      6040 when the VXLAN header is inserted between (or removed from between)
      IP headers. The authors of any future update to these specifications are
      encouraged to add a requirement to comply with RFC 6040 as updated by
      the present specification.<!--{ToDo: Update this text if the VXLAN-GPE draft gets updated before the present draft reaches the RFC Editor.}-->

      <t>The Network Service Header (NSH <xref target="RFC8300" format="default"/>) has been
      defined as a shim-based encapsulation to identify the Service Function

      when handling transport encapsulation <xref target="I-D.ietf-sfc-nsh-ecn-support" format="default"/>.</t>
      <t>The specifications of Geneve and GUE already refer to RFC 6040 for
      ECN encapsulation.</t>
      <t>Section 3.1.11 of RFC 8085 already explains that a tunnel that
      encapsulates an IP header within a UDP/IP datagram needs to follow RFC
      6040 when propagating the ECN field between inner and outer IP headers.
      The requirements in <xref target="rfc6040up_sec_safe" format="default"/> update RFC 6040,
      and hence implicitly update the UDP usage guidelines in RFC 8085 to add
      the important but previously unstated requirement that, if the UDP
      tunnel egress does not, or might not, support ECN propagation, a UDP
      tunnel ingress has to clear the outer IP ECN field to 0b00, e.g. by
      configuration.</t>
      <t>Section 12.5 of TCP Encapsulation of IKE and IPsec Packets <xref target="RFC8229" format="default"/> already recommends the compatibility mode of RFC 6040
      in this case, because there is not a one-to-one mapping between inner
      and outer packets.</t>

          <t>L2TPv3 <xref target="RFC3931" format="default"/> is used as a shim header between

          many types of layer 2 (L2) header. The L2TPv3 shim header
          encapsulates an L2-specific sub-layer then an L2 header that is
          likely to contain an inner IP header (v4 or v6). Then this whole
          stack of headers can be encapsulated optionally within an outer UDP
          header then an outer PSN header that is typically IP (v4 or v6).</t>
          <t>L2TPv2 is used as a shim header between any PSN header and a PPP
          header, which is in turn likely to encapsulate an IP header.</t>
          <t>Even though these shims are rather fat (particularly in the case
          of L2TPv3), they still fit the definition of a tightly coupled shim
          header over an encapsulating header (<xref target="rfc6040up_feasibility" format="default"/>), because all the headers
          encapsulating the L2 header are added (or removed) together. L2TPv2
          and L2TPv3 are therefore within the scope of RFC 6040, as updated by

              (before hiding) of this AVP MUST be 8 octets. The Vendor ID is

              <t>Bit 15 of the Value field of the LCCE Capability AVP is
              defined as the ECN Capability flag (E). When the ECN Capability
              flag is set to 1, it indicates that the sender supports ECN
              propagation. When the ECN Capability flag is cleared to zero, or
              when no LCCE Capabiliy AVP is present, it indicates that the
              sender does not support ECN propagation. All the other bits are
              reserved. They MUST be cleared to zero when sent and ignored
              when received or forwarded.</t>
              <t>An LCCE initiating a control connection will send a

              Start-Control-Connection-Reply (SCCRP) that also includes an
              LCCE Capability AVP with the ECN Capability flag set to 1. Then,
              for any sessions created by that control connection, both ends
              of the tunnel can use the normal mode of RFC 6040, i.e. it can
              copy the IP ECN field from inner to outer when encapsulating
              data packets.</t>
              <t>If, on the other hand, the tunnel terminator does not support
              ECN it will ignore the ECN flag in the LCCE Capability AVP and
              send an SCCRP to the tunnel initiator without a Capability AVP
              (or with a Capability AVP but with the ECN Capability flag
              cleared to zero). The tunnel initiator interprets the absence of
              the ECN Capability flag in the SCCRP as an indication that the
              tunnel terminator is incapable of supporting ECN. When
              encapsulating data packets for any sessions created by that
              control connection, the tunnel initiator will then use the
              compatibility mode of RFC 6040 to clear the ECN field of the
              outer IP header to 0b00.</t>
              <t>If the tunnel terminator does not support this ECN extension,

          the IPv6 outer.</t>
          <t>It is believed that current implementations do not support
          propagation of ECN, but that they do safely zero the ECN field in

          <t>To make existing Teredo deployments safe, it would be possible to

            <t>Bit 14 of the AMT Request Message counting from 0 (or bit 7 of
            the Reserved field counting from 1) is defined here as the AMT
            Gateway ECN Capability flag (E), as shown in <xref target="Fig_rfc6040up_AMT_ECN_Capability_Declaration" format="default"/>. The
            definitions of all other fields in the AMT Request Message are
            unchanged from RFC 7450.</t>
            <t>When the E flag is set to 1, it indicates that the sender of
            the message supports RFC 6040 ECN propagation. When it is cleared
            to zero, it indicates the sender of the message does not support
            RFC 6040 ECN propagation. An AMT gateway "that supports RFC 6040
            ECN propagation" means one that propagates the ECN field to the
            forwarded data packet based on the combination of arriving inner
            and outer ECN fields, as defined in Section 4 of RFC 6040.</t>
            <t>The other bits of the Reserved field remain reserved. They will
            continue to be cleared to zero when sent and ignored when either
            received or forwarded, as specified in Section 5.1.3.3. of RFC
            7450.</t>
            <t>An AMT gateway that does not support RFC 6040 MUST NOT set the
            E flag of its Request Message to 1.</t>
            <t>An AMT gateway that supports RFC 6040 ECN propagation MUST set
            the E flag of its Relay Discovery Message to 1.</t>
            <t>The action of the corresponding AMT relay that receives a
            Request message with the E flag set to 1 depends on whether the
            relay itself supports RFC 6040 ECN propagation:</t>
            <ul spacing="normal">
              <li>If the relay supports RFC 6040 ECN propagation, it will
                store the ECN capability of the gateway along with its
                address. Then whenever it tunnels datagrams towards this
                gateway, it MUST use the normal mode of RFC 6040 to propagate
                the ECN field when encapsulating datagrams (i.e. it copies the
                IP ECN field from inner to outer).</li>
              <li>
                <t>If the discovered AMT relay does not support RFC 6040 ECN
                propagation, it will ignore the E flag in the Reserved field,
                as per section 5.1.3.3. of RFC 7450. </t>
                <t>If the AMT relay does not support RFC 6040 ECN
                propagation, the network operator is still expected to
                configure it to comply with the safety provisions set out in
                <xref target="rfc6040up_AMT_Safe" format="default"/> above.</t>
